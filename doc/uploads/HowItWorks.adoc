# How ARA works

To understand how to upload reports on ARA, it's highly recommanded to read this part and learn how ARA works
internally.

## The Data model of ARA

ARA use a very basic data model internally :

### The Cycle

The Cycle represents a scheduled test execution on a given *Branch* (a VCS branch like a Git branch for example),
for a given *project*

For example, in the image bellow, the cycle `Day` represents all the executions on Develop for the Demo project
(here in red) :

A Cycle can be linked to several Executions.

### The Execution

The Execution represents the grouping of tests for different *test types* and *countries*.

For example, an execution may contains the reports of all the Cucumber and Postman tests for a french
environment on build X of the project.
In the image bellow, the red part is the execution :

An Execution may be composed of several Runs.

### The Run

The Run represents the execution of *one Test type* for *one given country* in an execution.

In the example bellow, we have two runs : `FR: Integ. APIs` and `FR: HMI Desktop` :

A Run may be composed of several Executed Scenario.

### The Executed Scenario

The Executed Scenario represent the execution of *One test Scenario* (either a Postman collection or a Cucumber
scenario for example).

In the image bellow, for one run, we have one Executed Scenario passing and one Executed Scenario failing :
